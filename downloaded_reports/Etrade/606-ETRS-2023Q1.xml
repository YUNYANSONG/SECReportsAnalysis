          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers. Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more. E*TRADE does not receive payment from Citadel for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share. E*TRADE routes NMS equity orders only to market makers that pay for customer order flow, and all such market makers pay substantially the same rates. In addition, to take advantage of rules adopted by the U.S. securities exchanges that allow retail orders to be eligible for certain potential benefits, including additional price improvement from retail liquidity programs and higher queue priority from retail attestation programs, and to allow Citadel to access such potential benefits for E*TRADE customer orders, E*TRADE has entered into a Retail Order Attestation and Agreement with Citadel whereby E*TRADE attests that substantially all of its customer orders are agency retail orders. E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel. 

There is a potential conflict to a market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. A market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among the three subcategories listed above, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by competition for order flow amongst market makers (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), operating under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Citadel.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Citadel receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel could potentially use these rebates to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to UBS. 

There is a potential conflict to a market maker such as UBS both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as UBS can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. A market maker’s (such as UBS’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among the three subcategories listed above, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by competition for order flow amongst market makers (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), operating under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to UBS.

In addition to revenues that UBS may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, UBS also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize UBS to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to UBS’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates UBS receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although UBS could potentially use these rebates to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes marketable equity orders and non-marketable NMS equity limit orders to the Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers, as specified in the above Public Order Routing Report statistics. E*TRADE either pays a fee or receives a rebate for each E*TRADE customer order execution on the exchange, depending on whether the order added to or subtracted from liquidity on the exchange. 

The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing. To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under NASDAQ’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply. Because NASDAQ offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to NASDAQ rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier. E*TRADE and NASDAQ do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule as described above; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to NASDAQ. 

The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from NASDAQ for NMS equity executions are determined based on NASDAQ’s tiered volume model. Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by NASDAQ in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule, available at http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=bx_pricing. Please note that NASDAQ’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, NASDAQ paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.00325 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and did not pay any per share amount for executions priced below $1.00 per share. Executions that removed liquidity from NASDAQ qualified for tiered pricing and E*TRADE was charged fees of $0.003 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and 0.30% of the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from NASDAQ in the amount of $92,775 in January, $95,645 in February, and $110,735 in March. 

E*TRADE also participates in NASDAQ’s retail order priority program under which eligible retail orders receive priority ahead of other available interest at a given price level or other enhanced execution benefits. E*TRADE reviews customers’ activity on a periodic basis to determine program eligibility and reserves the right to choose whether to participate in the NASDAQ retail order priority program. E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), which is a market maker on NASDAQ and may realize profits from orders it routes to NASDAQ for execution. E*TRADE may share indirectly in such profits generated by MS&amp;Co as a result of the corporate affiliation between MS&amp;Co and E*TRADE. E*TRADE and MS&amp;Co order execution volumes are combined on a monthly basis for tiered pricing program incentive purposes.

In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from G1X in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more. E*TRADE does not receive payment from G1X for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share. E*TRADE routes NMS equity orders only to market makers that pay for customer order flow, and all such market makers pay substantially the same rates. In addition, to take advantage of rules adopted by the U.S. securities exchanges that allow retail orders to be eligible for certain potential benefits, including additional price improvement from retail liquidity programs and higher queue priority from retail attestation programs, and to allow G1X to access such potential benefits for E*TRADE customer orders, E*TRADE has entered into a Retail Order Attestation and Agreement with G1X whereby E*TRADE attests that substantially all of its customer orders are agency retail orders. E*TRADE and G1X do not have any arrangements:

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to G1X. 

There is a potential conflict to a market maker such as G1X both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as G1X can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. A market maker’s (such as G1X’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among the three subcategories listed above, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by competition for order flow amongst market makers (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), operating under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to G1X.

In addition to revenues that G1X may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, G1X also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize G1X to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to G1X’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates G1X receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although G1X could potentially use these rebates to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

E*TRADE either pays a fee or receives a rebate for each E*TRADE customer order execution on the exchange, depending on whether the order added to or subtracted from liquidity on the exchange. 

The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing. To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under EDGX’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply. Because EDGX offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to EDGX rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier.

D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to EDGX. 

The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from EDGX for NMS equity executions are determined based on EDGX’s tiered volume model. Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by EDGX in the EDGX Fees Schedule, available at http://www.cboe.com/us/equities/membership/fee_schedule/edgx/. Please note that EDGX’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, EDGX paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.0034 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.00003 for executions priced below $1.00 per share. Executions that removed liquidity from EDGX qualified for tiered pricing and E*TRADE was not charged a per share fee for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more or charged a per share fee of the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from EDGX in the amount of $131,204 in January, $122,006 in February, and $163,611 in March. 

E*TRADE also participates in EDGX’s retail order priority program under which eligible retail orders receive priority ahead of other available interest at a given price level or other enhanced execution benefits.

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes marketable equity orders and non-marketable NMS equity limit orders to MEMX LLC (“MEMX”) as specified in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures. E*TRADE either pays a fee or receives a rebate for each E*TRADE customer order execution on the exchange, depending on whether the order added to or subtracted from liquidity on the exchange.
 
The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing. To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under MEMX’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply. Because MEMX offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to MEMX rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier. E*TRADE and MEMX do not have any arrangements:
 
A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds;
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the MEMX Fees Schedule as described above; or
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to MEMX.
 
The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from MEMX for NMS equity executions are determined based on MEMX’s tiered volume model. Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by MEMX in the MEMX Fees Schedule, available at http://info.memxtrading.com/fee-schedule/. Please note that MEMX’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, MEMX paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.0035 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and 0.075% of the total trade notional value for executions priced below $1.00 per share. On executions that removed liquidity from MEMX qualified for tiered pricing, E*TRADE was not charged a per share fee for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more nor charged a per share fee for the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from MEMX in the amount of $26,215 in January, $4,156 in February, and $9,328 in March.
 
E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Strategic Investments I, Inc., both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley and investor-shareholders of MEMX. Accordingly, E*TRADE, both directly and indirectly through its parent company Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates may share in profits realized by MEMX, which could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to MEMX over other execution venues. Additionally, E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), which is market maker on MEMX and may realize profits from orders it routes to MEMX for execution. E*TRADE may share directly or indirectly in any such profits generated by MS&amp;Co. E*TRADE orders routed to MEMX through MS&amp;Co will be combined with any other order flow that MS&amp;Co routes to MEMX for the purpose of determining the applicable pricing under MEMX’s tiered pricing model described above. It is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing program.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes U.S.-listed options orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers. Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders. E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis. E*TRADE routes U.S.-listed options orders only (except as indicated in the next sentence) to market makers that pay for customer order flow (and all such market makers pay substantially the same rates).  As an exception to the foregoing sentence, E*TRADE routes a limited number of orders to its affiliate, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), from which E*TRADE does not accept payment. E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel. 

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract, depending on the index option class and premium price, with Citadel passing exchange fees for index option executions back to E*TRADE each month. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index options executions of $329,202 in January, $303,226 in February, and $368,424 in March. 

There is a potential conflict to an options market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the options market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, an options market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. An options market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by market maker competition for order flow (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Citadel.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligation. Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer order executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates could potentially be used to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both. Citadel does not pass through the fees that it is charged by the U.S. options exchanges for E*TRADE customer options order executions, other than the index options fees described above.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes U.S.-listed options orders to Dash Financial Technologies, LLC (“Dash”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers. Dash generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from Dash (based upon the remuneration Dash receives from the liquidity providers with which it has arrangements as described below) (i.e. payment for order flow) in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders. E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Dash for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis. E*TRADE only routes U.S.-listed options orders to market makers that pay for customer order flow, and all such market makers are subject to substantially the same rate of payment, apart from a limited number of orders, which E*TRADE routes to its affiliate Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), from which E*TRADE does not accept payment. E*TRADE and Dash do not have any arrangements:

C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Dash.

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract depending on the index option class and premium price, with Dash passing exchange fees for index option executions to E*TRADE each month. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index option executions of $615,579 in January, $591,332 in February, and $723,016 in March. 

In connection with Dash ’s handling of E*TRADE retail equity option orders, Dash has arrangements with multiple, unaffiliated liquidity providers, including IMC Financial Markets, designed to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities. Pursuant to these arrangements, Dash routes E*TRADE retail equity options orders to exchanges and may preference the liquidity providers on such applicable exchange, consistent with exchange-sponsored programs which are described in the fee schedules of each such options exchange. The liquidity providers provide Dash with remuneration in connection with Dash ’s routing of E*TRADE retail equity options orders, including through reciprocal order flow arrangements between Dash and such liquidity provider and/or payment per contract to Dash in return for E*TRADE retail equity options orders that Dash routes or directs. Dash provides payment to E*TRADE as described above based upon the compensation Dash receives from such liquidity providers.

There is a potential conflict to Dash and/or the liquidity provider to which Dash routes orders both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the liquidity provider seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, the liquidity provider can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay Dash (and for Dash, in turn, to pay E*TRADE) for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. The liquidity provider’s anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories. Dash and the liquidity provider can also adjust the amount of profit that the liquidity provider shares with Dash. The allocation of resources between the three subcategories listed above, including the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders is mitigated by market maker competition for order flow (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Dash. 

In addition to revenues that Dash may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Dash may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates.

Dash and/or its liquidity provider does not pass through the fees charged by the U.S. options exchanges for E*TRADE customer executions, other than the index options fees described above. E*TRADE does not share directly in any profits from U.S. options exchange rebates for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Dash’s and/or its liquidity provider’s receipt of such rebates could potentially be used to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) is an affiliate of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., LLC. (MS&amp;Co). E*TRADE sends orders in U.S.-listed options to MS&amp;Co to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  E*TRADE orders in U.S.-listed options that are sent to MS&amp;Co are then routed by MS&amp;Co to a U.S. options exchange to be either crossed or executed against MS&amp;Co interest and/or other liquidity on such exchanges, subject to the principles of best execution. MS&amp;Co generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. E*TRADE does not receive payments from MS&amp;Co for the orders it routes to MS&amp;Co and E*TRADE and MS&amp;Co do not have any arrangements:

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to MS&amp;Co.

In the course of providing liquidity, MS&amp;Co may preference option orders to MS&amp;Co’s options market maker or third-party market makers on the applicable exchange, consistent with exchange-sponsored programs which are described in the fee schedules of each such options exchange. MS&amp;Co also participates in exchange-sponsored listed option payment for order flow programs under which MS&amp;Co may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates, including from exchanges in which E*TRADE’s parent company Morgan Stanley or another affiliated entity may have a financial interest. Although MSSB has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize MS&amp;Co to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to MS&amp;Co’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. Exchange rebates provided and fees charged to MS&amp;Co for E*TRADE customer executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  However, E*TRADE is an affiliated company of MS&amp;Co, which is a market maker on various U.S. options exchanges and MS&amp;Co may realize market-making profits from E*TRADE orders routed to MS&amp;Co for execution.  In addition, E*TRADE orders that MS&amp;Co executes are combined on a monthly basis with other order flow that MS&amp;Co executes for tiered pricing program incentive purposes and it is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing programs.  As a result of E*TRADE’s corporate affiliation with MS&amp;Co, E*TRADE may share indirectly in any such profits (whether from market-making, from pricing programs, or otherwise) generated by MS&amp;Co.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers. Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more. E*TRADE does not receive payment from Citadel for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share. E*TRADE routes NMS equity orders only to market makers that pay for customer order flow, and all such market makers pay substantially the same rates. In addition, to take advantage of rules adopted by the U.S. securities exchanges that allow retail orders to be eligible for certain potential benefits, including additional price improvement from retail liquidity programs and higher queue priority from retail attestation programs, and to allow Citadel to access such potential benefits for E*TRADE customer orders, E*TRADE has entered into a Retail Order Attestation and Agreement with Citadel whereby E*TRADE attests that substantially all of its customer orders are agency retail orders. E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel. 

There is a potential conflict to a market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. A market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among the three subcategories listed above, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by competition for order flow amongst market makers (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), operating under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Citadel.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Citadel receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel could potentially use these rebates to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to UBS Securities, LLC (“UBS”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers. UBS generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from UBS in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more. E*TRADE does not receive payment from UBS for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share. E*TRADE routes NMS equity orders only to market makers that pay for customer order flow, and all such market makers pay substantially the same rates. In addition, to take advantage of rules adopted by the U.S. securities exchanges that allow retail orders to be eligible for certain potential benefits, including additional price improvement from retail liquidity programs and higher queue priority from retail attestation programs, and to allow UBS to access such potential benefits for E*TRADE customer orders, E*TRADE has entered into a Retail Order Attestation and Agreement with UBS whereby E*TRADE attests that substantially all of its customer orders are agency retail orders. E*TRADE and UBS do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to UBS. 

There is a potential conflict to a market maker such as UBS both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as UBS can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. A market maker’s (such as UBS’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among the three subcategories listed above, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by competition for order flow amongst market makers (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), operating under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to UBS.

In addition to revenues that UBS may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, UBS also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize UBS to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to UBS’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates UBS receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although UBS could potentially use these rebates to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes marketable equity orders and non-marketable NMS equity limit orders to the Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers, as specified in the above Public Order Routing Report statistics. E*TRADE either pays a fee or receives a rebate for each E*TRADE customer order execution on the exchange, depending on whether the order added to or subtracted from liquidity on the exchange. 

The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing. To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under NASDAQ’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply. Because NASDAQ offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to NASDAQ rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier. E*TRADE and NASDAQ do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule as described above; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to NASDAQ. 

The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from NASDAQ for NMS equity executions are determined based on NASDAQ’s tiered volume model. Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by NASDAQ in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule, available at http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=bx_pricing. Please note that NASDAQ’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, NASDAQ paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.00325 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and did not pay any per share amount for executions priced below $1.00 per share. Executions that removed liquidity from NASDAQ qualified for tiered pricing and E*TRADE was charged fees of $0.003 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and 0.30% of the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from NASDAQ in the amount of $92,775 in January, $95,645 in February, and $110,735 in March. 

E*TRADE also participates in NASDAQ’s retail order priority program under which eligible retail orders receive priority ahead of other available interest at a given price level or other enhanced execution benefits. E*TRADE reviews customers’ activity on a periodic basis to determine program eligibility and reserves the right to choose whether to participate in the NASDAQ retail order priority program. E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), which is a market maker on NASDAQ and may realize profits from orders it routes to NASDAQ for execution. E*TRADE may share indirectly in such profits generated by MS&amp;Co as a result of the corporate affiliation between MS&amp;Co and E*TRADE. E*TRADE and MS&amp;Co order execution volumes are combined on a monthly basis for tiered pricing program incentive purposes. It is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing program.</materialAspects>

In addition to revenues that Virtu may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Virtu also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Virtu to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Virtu’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Virtu receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Virtu could potentially use these rebates to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

(“EDGX”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers, as specified in the above Public Order Routing Report statistics. E*TRADE either pays a fee or receives a rebate for each E*TRADE customer order execution on the exchange, depending on whether the order added to or subtracted from liquidity on the exchange. 

The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing. To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under EDGX’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply. Because EDGX offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to EDGX rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier. E*TRADE and EDGX do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the EDGX Fees Schedule as described above; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to EDGX. 

The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from EDGX for NMS equity executions are determined based on EDGX’s tiered volume model. Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by EDGX in the EDGX Fees Schedule, available at http://www.cboe.com/us/equities/membership/fee_schedule/edgx/. Please note that EDGX’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, EDGX paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.0032 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.00003 for executions priced below $1.00 per share. Executions that removed liquidity from EDGX qualified for tiered pricing and E*TRADE was not charged a per share fee for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more or charged a per share fee of the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from EDGX in the amount of $131,204 in January, $122,006 in February, and $163,611 in March. 

E*TRADE also participates in EDGX’s retail order priority program under which eligible retail orders receive priority ahead of other available interest at a given price level or other enhanced execution benefits. E*TRADE reviews customers’ activity on a periodic basis to determine program eligibility and reserves the right to choose whether to participate in the EDGX’s retail order priority program. E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), which is a market maker on EDGX and may realize profits from orders it routes to EDGX for execution. E*TRADE may share indirectly in such profits generated by MS&amp;Co as a result of the corporate affiliation between MS&amp;Co and E*TRADE. E*TRADE and MS&amp;Co order execution volumes are combined on a monthly basis for tiered pricing program incentive purposes. It is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing program.</materialAspects>

Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by NASDAQ in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule, available at http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=bx_pricing. Please note that NASDAQ’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, NASDAQ paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.00325 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and did not pay any per share amount for executions priced below $1.00 per share. Executions that removed liquidity from NASDAQ qualified for tiered pricing and E*TRADE was charged fees of $0.003 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and 0.30% of the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from NASDAQ in the amount of $92,775 in January, $95,645 in February, and $110,735 in March. 

E*TRADE also participates in NASDAQ’s retail order priority program under which eligible retail orders receive priority ahead of other available interest at a given price level or other enhanced execution benefits. E*TRADE reviews customers’ activity on a periodic basis to determine program eligibility and reserves the right to choose whether to participate in the NASDAQ retail order priority program. E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), which is a market maker on NASDAQ and may realize profits from orders it routes to NASDAQ for execution. E*TRADE may share indirectly in such profits generated by MS&amp;Co as a result of the corporate affiliation between MS&amp;Co and E*TRADE. E*TRADE and MS&amp;Co order execution volumes are combined on a monthly basis for tiered pricing program incentive purposes. It is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing program.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes marketable equity orders and non-marketable NMS equity limit orders to MEMX LLC (“MEMX”) as specified in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures. E*TRADE either pays a fee or receives a rebate for each E*TRADE customer order execution on the exchange, depending on whether the order added to or subtracted from liquidity on the exchange.
 
The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing. To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under MEMX’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply. Because MEMX offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to MEMX rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier. E*TRADE and MEMX do not have any arrangements:
 
A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds;
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the MEMX Fees Schedule as described above; or
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to MEMX.
 
The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from MEMX for NMS equity executions are determined based on MEMX’s tiered volume model. Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by MEMX in the MEMX Fees Schedule, available at http://info.memxtrading.com/fee-schedule/. Please note that MEMX’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, MEMX paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.0035 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and 0.075% of the total trade notional value for executions priced below $1.00 per share. On executions that removed liquidity from MEMX qualified for tiered pricing, E*TRADE was not charged a per share fee for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more nor charged a per share fee for the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from MEMX in the amount of $26,215 in January, $4,156 in February, and $9,328 in March.
 
E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Strategic Investments I, Inc., both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley and investor-shareholders of MEMX. Accordingly, E*TRADE, both directly and indirectly through its parent company Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates may share in profits realized by MEMX, which could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to MEMX over other execution venues. Additionally, E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), which is market maker on MEMX and may realize profits from orders it routes to MEMX for execution. E*TRADE may share directly or indirectly in any such profits generated by MS&amp;Co. E*TRADE orders routed to MEMX through MS&amp;Co will be combined with any other order flow that MS&amp;Co routes to MEMX for the purpose of determining the applicable pricing under MEMX’s tiered pricing model described above. It is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing program.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes U.S.-listed options orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers. Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders. E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis. E*TRADE routes U.S.-listed options orders only (except as indicated in the next sentence) to market makers that pay for customer order flow (and all such market makers pay substantially the same rates).  As an exception to the foregoing sentence, E*TRADE routes a limited number of orders to its affiliate, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), from which E*TRADE does not accept payment. E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel. 

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract, depending on the index option class and premium price, with Citadel passing exchange fees for index option executions back to E*TRADE each month. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index options executions of $329,202 in January, $303,226 in February, and $368,424 in March. 

There is a potential conflict to an options market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the options market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, an options market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. An options market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by market maker competition for order flow (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Citadel.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligation. Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer order executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates could potentially be used to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both. Citadel does not pass through the fees that it is charged by the U.S. options exchanges for E*TRADE customer options order executions, other than the index options fees described above.</materialAspects>

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract, depending on the index option class and premium price, with G1X passing exchange fees for index option executions back to E*TRADE each month. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index options executions of $174,831 in January, $179,757 in February, and $240,281 in March.

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes U.S.-listed options orders to Dash Financial Technologies, LLC (“Dash”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers. Dash generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from Dash (based upon the remuneration Dash receives from the liquidity providers with which it has arrangements as described below) (i.e. payment for order flow) in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders. E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Dash for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis.

C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Dash.

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract depending on the index option class and premium price, with Dash passing exchange fees for index option executions to E*TRADE each month. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index option executions of $615,579 in January, $591,332 in February, and $723,016 in March. 

In connection with Dash ’s handling of E*TRADE retail equity option orders, Dash has arrangements with multiple, unaffiliated liquidity providers, including IMC Financial Markets, designed to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities. Pursuant to these arrangements, Dash routes E*TRADE retail equity options orders to exchanges and may preference the liquidity providers on such applicable exchange, consistent with exchange-sponsored programs which are described in the fee schedules of each such options exchange. The liquidity providers provide Dash with remuneration in connection with Dash ’s routing of E*TRADE retail equity options orders, including through reciprocal order flow arrangements between Dash and such liquidity provider and/or payment per contract to Dash in return for E*TRADE retail equity options orders that Dash routes or directs. Dash provides payment to E*TRADE as described above based upon the compensation Dash receives from such liquidity providers.

There is a potential conflict to Dash and/or the liquidity provider to which Dash routes orders both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the liquidity provider seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, the liquidity provider can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay Dash (and for Dash, in turn, to pay E*TRADE) for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. The liquidity provider’s anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories. Dash and the liquidity provider can also adjust the amount of profit that the liquidity provider shares with Dash. The allocation of resources between the three subcategories listed above, including the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders is mitigated by market maker competition for order flow (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Dash. 

In addition to revenues that Dash may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Dash may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates.

An options market maker’s (such as Wolverine’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by market maker competition for order flow (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Wolverine.

In addition to revenues that Wolverine may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Wolverine may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Wolverine to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Wolverine’s independent order routing and best execution obligation. Exchange rebates provided to Wolverine for E*TRADE customer order executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers although Wolverine’s receipt of such rebates could potentially be used to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both. Wolverine does not pass through the fees that it is charged by the U.S. options exchanges for E*TRADE customer options order executions, other than the index options fees described above.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) is an affiliate of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., LLC. (MS&amp;Co). E*TRADE sends orders in U.S.-listed options to MS&amp;Co to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  E*TRADE orders in U.S.-listed options that are sent to MS&amp;Co are then routed by MS&amp;Co to a U.S. options exchange to be either crossed or executed against MS&amp;Co interest and/or other liquidity on such exchanges, subject to the principles of best execution. MS&amp;Co generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. E*TRADE does not receive payments from MS&amp;Co for the orders it routes to MS&amp;Co and E*TRADE and MS&amp;Co do not have any arrangements:

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to MS&amp;Co.

In the course of providing liquidity, MS&amp;Co may preference option orders to MS&amp;Co’s options market maker or third-party market makers on the applicable exchange, consistent with exchange-sponsored programs which are described in the fee schedules of each such options exchange. MS&amp;Co also participates in exchange-sponsored listed option payment for order flow programs under which MS&amp;Co may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates, including from exchanges in which E*TRADE’s parent company Morgan Stanley or another affiliated entity may have a financial interest. Although MSSB has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize MS&amp;Co to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to MS&amp;Co’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. Exchange rebates provided and fees charged to MS&amp;Co for E*TRADE customer executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  However, E*TRADE is an affiliated company of MS&amp;Co, which is a market maker on various U.S. options exchanges and MS&amp;Co may realize market-making profits from E*TRADE orders routed to MS&amp;Co for execution.  In addition, E*TRADE orders that MS&amp;Co executes are combined on a monthly basis with other order flow that MS&amp;Co executes for tiered pricing program incentive purposes and it is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing programs.  As a result of E*TRADE’s corporate affiliation with MS&amp;Co, E*TRADE may share indirectly in any such profits (whether from market-making, from pricing programs, or otherwise) generated by MS&amp;Co.</materialAspects>

E*TRADE does not receive payment from Two Sigma for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share. E*TRADE routes NMS equity orders only to market makers that pay for customer order flow, and all such market makers pay substantially the same rates. In addition, to take advantage of rules adopted by the U.S. securities exchanges that allow retail orders to be eligible for certain potential benefits, including additional price improvement from retail liquidity programs and higher queue priority from retail attestation programs, and to allow Two Sigma to access such potential benefits for E*TRADE customer orders, E*TRADE has entered into a Retail Order Attestation and Agreement with Two Sigma whereby E*TRADE attests that substantially all of its customer orders are agency retail orders. E*TRADE and Two Sigma do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Two Sigma. 

There is a potential conflict to a market maker such as Two Sigma both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Two Sigma can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. A market maker’s (such as Two Sigma’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among the three subcategories listed above, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by competition for order flow amongst market makers (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), operating under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Two Sigma.

In addition to revenues that Two Sigma may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Two Sigma also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Two Sigma to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Two Sigma’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Two Sigma receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Two Sigma could potentially use these rebates to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

E*TRADE either pays a fee or receives a rebate for each E*TRADE customer order execution on the exchange, depending on whether the order added to or subtracted from liquidity on the exchange. 

The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing. To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under NASDAQ’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply. Because NASDAQ offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to NASDAQ rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier. E*TRADE and NASDAQ do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule as described above; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to NASDAQ. 

The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from NASDAQ for NMS equity executions are determined based on NASDAQ’s tiered volume model. Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by NASDAQ in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule, available at http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=bx_pricing. Please note that NASDAQ’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, NASDAQ paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.00325 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and did not pay any per share amount for executions priced below $1.00 per share. Executions that removed liquidity from NASDAQ qualified for tiered pricing and E*TRADE was charged fees of $0.003 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and 0.30% of the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from NASDAQ in the amount of $92,775 in January, $95,645 in February, and $110,735 in March. 

E*TRADE also participates in NASDAQ’s retail order priority program under which eligible retail orders receive priority ahead of other available interest at a given price level or other enhanced execution benefits. E*TRADE reviews customers’ activity on a periodic basis to determine program eligibility and reserves the right to choose whether to participate in the NASDAQ retail order priority program. E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), which is a market maker on NASDAQ and may realize profits from orders it routes to NASDAQ for execution.

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers. Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more. E*TRADE does not receive payment from Citadel for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share. E*TRADE routes NMS equity orders only to market makers that pay for customer order flow, and all such market makers pay substantially the same rates. In addition, to take advantage of rules adopted by the U.S. securities exchanges that allow retail orders to be eligible for certain potential benefits, including additional price improvement from retail liquidity programs and higher queue priority from retail attestation programs, and to allow Citadel to access such potential benefits for E*TRADE customer orders, E*TRADE has entered into a Retail Order Attestation and Agreement with Citadel whereby E*TRADE attests that substantially all of its customer orders are agency retail orders. E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel. 

There is a potential conflict to a market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. A market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among the three subcategories listed above, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by competition for order flow amongst market makers (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), operating under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Citadel.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Citadel receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel could potentially use these rebates to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Virtu Americas, LLC (“Virtu”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers. Virtu generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from Virtu in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more. E*TRADE does not receive payment from Virtu for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share. E*TRADE routes NMS equity orders only to market makers that pay for customer order flow, and all such market makers pay substantially the same rates. In addition, to take advantage of rules adopted by the U.S. securities exchanges that allow retail orders to be eligible for certain potential benefits, including additional price improvement from retail liquidity programs and higher queue priority from retail attestation programs, and to allow Virtu to access such potential benefits for E*TRADE customer orders, E*TRADE has entered into a Retail Order Attestation and Agreement with Virtu whereby E*TRADE attests that substantially all of its customer orders are agency retail orders. E*TRADE and Virtu do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Virtu. 

There is a potential conflict to a market maker such as Virtu both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Virtu can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. A market maker’s (such as Virtu’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among the three subcategories listed above, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by competition for order flow amongst market makers (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), operating under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Virtu.

In addition to revenues that Virtu may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Virtu also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Virtu to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Virtu’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Virtu receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Virtu could potentially use these rebates to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes marketable equity orders and non-marketable NMS equity limit orders to the Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (“EDGX”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers, as specified in the above Public Order Routing Report statistics. E*TRADE either pays a fee or receives a rebate for each E*TRADE customer order execution on the exchange, depending on whether the order added to or subtracted from liquidity on the exchange. 

The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing. To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under EDGX’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply. Because EDGX offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to EDGX rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier. E*TRADE and EDGX do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the EDGX Fees Schedule as described above; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to EDGX. 

The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from EDGX for NMS equity executions are determined based on EDGX’s tiered volume model. Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by EDGX in the EDGX Fees Schedule, available at http://www.cboe.com/us/equities/membership/fee_schedule/edgx/. Please note that EDGX’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, EDGX paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.0034 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.00003 for executions priced below $1.00 per share. Executions that removed liquidity from EDGX qualified for tiered pricing and E*TRADE was not charged a per share fee for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more or charged a per share fee of the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from EDGX in the amount of $131,204 in January, $122,006 in February, and $163,611 in March. 

E*TRADE also participates in EDGX’s retail order priority program under which eligible retail orders receive priority ahead of other available interest at a given price level or other enhanced execution benefits. E*TRADE reviews customers’ activity on a periodic basis to determine program eligibility and reserves the right to choose whether to participate in the EDGX’s retail order priority program. E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), which is a market maker on EDGX and may realize profits from orders it routes to EDGX for execution. E*TRADE may share indirectly in such profits generated by MS&amp;Co as a result of the corporate affiliation between MS&amp;Co and E*TRADE. E*TRADE and MS&amp;Co order execution volumes are combined on a monthly basis for tiered pricing program incentive purposes. It is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing program.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes marketable equity orders and non-marketable NMS equity limit orders to the Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers, as specified in the above Public Order Routing Report statistics. E*TRADE either pays a fee or receives a rebate for each E*TRADE customer order execution on the exchange, depending on whether the order added to or subtracted from liquidity on the exchange. 

The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing. To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under NASDAQ’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply. Because NASDAQ offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to NASDAQ rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier. E*TRADE and NASDAQ do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule as described above; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to NASDAQ. 

The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from NASDAQ for NMS equity executions are determined based on NASDAQ’s tiered volume model. Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by NASDAQ in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule, available at http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=bx_pricing. Please note that NASDAQ’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, NASDAQ paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.00325 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and did not pay any per share amount for executions priced below $1.00 per share. Executions that removed liquidity from NASDAQ qualified for tiered pricing and E*TRADE was charged fees of $0.003 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and 0.30% of the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from NASDAQ in the amount of $92,775 in January, $95,645 in February, and $110,735 in March. 

E*TRADE also participates in NASDAQ’s retail order priority program under which eligible retail orders receive priority ahead of other available interest at a given price level or other enhanced execution benefits. E*TRADE reviews customers’ activity on a periodic basis to determine program eligibility and reserves the right to choose whether to participate in the NASDAQ retail order priority program. E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), which is a market maker on NASDAQ and may realize profits from orders it routes to NASDAQ for execution. E*TRADE may share indirectly in such profits generated by MS&amp;Co as a result of the corporate affiliation between MS&amp;Co and E*TRADE. E*TRADE and MS&amp;Co order execution volumes are combined on a monthly basis for tiered pricing program incentive purposes. It is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing program.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes marketable equity orders and non-marketable NMS equity limit orders to MEMX LLC (“MEMX”) as specified in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures. E*TRADE either pays a fee or receives a rebate for each E*TRADE customer order execution on the exchange, depending on whether the order added to or subtracted from liquidity on the exchange.
 
The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing. To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under MEMX’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply. Because MEMX offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to MEMX rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier. E*TRADE and MEMX do not have any arrangements:
 
A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds;
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the MEMX Fees Schedule as described above; or
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to MEMX.
 
The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from MEMX for NMS equity executions are determined based on MEMX’s tiered volume model. Schedules delineating orders eligible for such rebates and the applicable rates are published publicly by MEMX in the MEMX Fees Schedule, available at http://info.memxtrading.com/fee-schedule/. Please note that MEMX’s publicly available Fees Schedule URL link and applicable rates may change without notice. In general, during Q1 2023, MEMX paid E*TRADE standard rebate rates of $0.0034 per share for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and 0.075% of the total trade notional value for executions priced below $1.00 per share. On executions that removed liquidity from MEMX qualified for tiered pricing, E*TRADE was not charged a per share fee for executions priced at $1.00 per share or more nor charged a per share fee for the total notional value of executions priced below $1.00 per share. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE received rebates (net of fees) from MEMX in the amount of $26,215 in January, $4,156 in February, and $9,328 in March.
 
E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Strategic Investments I, Inc., both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley and investor-shareholders of MEMX. Accordingly, E*TRADE, both directly and indirectly through its parent company Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates may share in profits realized by MEMX, which could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to MEMX over other execution venues. Additionally, E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), which is market maker on MEMX and may realize profits from orders it routes to MEMX for execution. E*TRADE may share directly or indirectly in any such profits generated by MS&amp;Co. E*TRADE orders routed to MEMX through MS&amp;Co will be combined with any other order flow that MS&amp;Co routes to MEMX for the purpose of determining the applicable pricing under MEMX’s tiered pricing model described above. It is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing program.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes U.S.-listed options orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers. Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders. E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis. E*TRADE routes U.S.-listed options orders only (except as indicated in the next sentence) to market makers that pay for customer order flow (and all such market makers pay substantially the same rates).  As an exception to the foregoing sentence, E*TRADE routes a limited number of orders to its affiliate, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), from which E*TRADE does not accept payment. E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements: 

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds; 
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or 
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel. 

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract, depending on the index option class and premium price, with Citadel passing exchange fees for index option executions back to E*TRADE each month. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index options executions of $329,202 in January, $303,226 in February, and $368,424 in March. 

There is a potential conflict to an options market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the options market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, an options market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. An options market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories, with the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders mitigated by market maker competition for order flow (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Citadel.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligation. Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer order executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates could potentially be used to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both. Citadel does not pass through the fees that it is charged by the U.S. options exchanges for E*TRADE customer options order executions, other than the index options fees described above.</materialAspects>

In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives payments from Dash (based upon the remuneration Dash receives from the liquidity providers with which it has arrangements as described below) (i.e. payment for order flow) in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures (i.e. payment for order flow), calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders. E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Dash for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis. E*TRADE only routes U.S.-listed options orders to market makers that pay for customer order flow, and all such market makers are subject to substantially the same rate of payment, apart from a limited number of orders, which E*TRADE routes to its affiliate Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., LLC (“MS&amp;Co”), from which E*TRADE does not accept payment. E*TRADE and Dash do not have any arrangements:

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Dash.

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract depending on the index option class and premium price, with Dash passing exchange fees for index option executions to E*TRADE each month. For Q1 2023, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index option executions of $615,579 in January, $591,332 in February, and $723,016 in March. 

In connection with Dash ’s handling of E*TRADE retail equity option orders, Dash has arrangements with multiple, unaffiliated liquidity providers, including IMC Financial Markets, designed to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities. Pursuant to these arrangements, Dash routes E*TRADE retail equity options orders to exchanges and may preference the liquidity providers on such applicable exchange, consistent with exchange-sponsored programs which are described in the fee schedules of each such options exchange. The liquidity providers provide Dash with remuneration in connection with Dash ’s routing of E*TRADE retail equity options orders, including through reciprocal order flow arrangements between Dash and such liquidity provider and/or payment per contract to Dash in return for E*TRADE retail equity options orders that Dash routes or directs. Dash provides payment to E*TRADE as described above based upon the compensation Dash receives from such liquidity providers.

There is a potential conflict to Dash and/or the liquidity provider to which Dash routes orders both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the liquidity provider seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, the liquidity provider can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay Dash (and for Dash, in turn, to pay E*TRADE) for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow. The liquidity provider’s anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories. Dash and the liquidity provider can also adjust the amount of profit that the liquidity provider shares with Dash. The allocation of resources between the three subcategories listed above, including the risk of overallocation to market maker profits at the expense of providing price improvement on E*TRADE customer orders is mitigated by market maker competition for order flow (as measured by the amount of price improvement provided), under the same general payment for order flow terms applicable to Dash. 

In addition to revenues that Dash may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Dash may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates. Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Dash to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Dash’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. Exchange rebates provided to Dash for E*TRADE customer executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers. Dash and/or its liquidity provider does not pass through the fees charged by the U.S. options exchanges for E*TRADE customer executions, other than the index options fees described above. E*TRADE does not share directly in any profits from U.S. options exchange rebates for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Dash’s and/or its liquidity provider’s receipt of such rebates could potentially be used to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payments to E*TRADE, or both.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) is an affiliate of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., LLC. (MS&amp;Co). E*TRADE sends orders in U.S.-listed options to MS&amp;Co to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  E*TRADE orders in U.S.-listed options that are sent to MS&amp;Co are then routed by MS&amp;Co to a U.S. options exchange to be either crossed or executed against MS&amp;Co interest and/or other liquidity on such exchanges, subject to the principles of best execution. MS&amp;Co generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders. E*TRADE does not receive payments from MS&amp;Co for the orders it routes to MS&amp;Co and E*TRADE and MS&amp;Co do not have any arrangements:

A. that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B. that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C. for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D. that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to MS&amp;Co.

In the course of providing liquidity, MS&amp;Co may preference option orders to MS&amp;Co’s options market maker or third-party market makers on the applicable exchange, consistent with exchange-sponsored programs which are described in the fee schedules of each such options exchange. MS&amp;Co also participates in exchange-sponsored listed option payment for order flow programs under which MS&amp;Co may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates, including from exchanges in which E*TRADE’s parent company Morgan Stanley or another affiliated entity may have a financial interest. Although MSSB has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize MS&amp;Co to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to MS&amp;Co’s independent order routing and best execution obligations. Exchange rebates provided and fees charged to MS&amp;Co for E*TRADE customer executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  However, E*TRADE is an affiliated company of MS&amp;Co, which is a market maker on various U.S. options exchanges and MS&amp;Co may realize market-making profits from E*TRADE orders routed to MS&amp;Co for execution.  In addition, E*TRADE orders that MS&amp;Co executes are combined on a monthly basis with other order flow that MS&amp;Co executes for tiered pricing program incentive purposes and it is possible that MS&amp;Co could generate additional profit as a result of the combination of such order flow and the incentives of such tiered pricing programs.  As a result of E*TRADE’s corporate affiliation with MS&amp;Co, E*TRADE may share indirectly in any such profits (whether from market-making, from pricing programs, or otherwise) generated by MS&amp;Co.</materialAspects>
