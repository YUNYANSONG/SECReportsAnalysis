FBS does, however, receive compensation from options exchanges and/or brokers associated with the routing of options order flow. 
Options markets are structurally different from equities markets. Options orders require the use of specialized options brokers to deliver price improvement, all options trades must occur on ​an exchange and are subject to exchange pricing schedules. Brokers may pass to FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, a portion of the compensation they generate via exchange executions.
Options orders in some securities, such as index options, may incur execution costs rather than rebates, and options brokers may pass through those execution costs to NFS. Index options may be routed to options brokers with different allocations than non-index options, and as such, the per-contract fees and rebates may look materially different across options brokers.</materialAspects>

Rebates are generally for limit orders required to be displayed on exchange per the SEC Limit Order Display Rule but may also include marketable orders executed on certain exchanges.

FBS does, however, receive compensation from options exchanges and/or brokers associated with the routing of options order flow. 
Options markets are structurally different from equities markets. Options orders require the use of specialized options brokers to deliver price improvement, all options trades must occur on ​an exchange and are subject to exchange pricing schedules. Brokers may pass to FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, a portion of the compensation they generate via exchange executions.
Options orders in some securities, such as index options, may incur execution costs rather than rebates, and options brokers may pass through those execution costs to NFS. Index options may be routed to options brokers with different allocations than non-index options, and as such, the per-contract fees and rebates may look materially different across options brokers.
In connection with Dash Financial’s handling of retail listed option orders, Dash has arrangements with multiple unaffiliated liquidity providers, including IMC Chicago, designed to facilitate liquidity and price improvement opportunities. Pursuant to these arrangements, Dash routes listed option orders to exchanges and preferences the liquidity providers consistent with exchange sponsored programs.</materialAspects>

Rebates are generally for limit orders required to be displayed on exchange per the SEC Limit Order Display Rule but may also include marketable orders executed on certain exchanges.
Economics associated with Market orders, Marketable Limit orders and Other orders may represent a variety of different interaction types on the exchange, including but not limited to: participating in the exchange’s opening or closing auction; displaying limit orders on the exchange; and removing liquidity on the exchange.

                    <materialAspects>FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, does not negotiate, set rates for, or solicit payment​ for order flow on option orders. FBS does, however, receive compensation from options exchanges and/or brokers associated with the routing of options order flow. 
Options markets are structurally different from equities markets. Options orders require the use of specialized options brokers to deliver price improvement, all options trades must occur on ​an exchange and are subject to exchange pricing schedules. Brokers may pass to FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, a portion of the compensation they generate via exchange executions.
Options orders in some securities, such as index options, may incur execution costs rather than rebates, and options brokers may pass through those execution costs to NFS. Index options may be routed to options brokers with different allocations than non-index options, and as such, the per-contract fees and rebates may look materially different across options brokers.</materialAspects>

                    <materialAspects>FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, does not negotiate, set rates for, or solicit payment​ for order flow on option orders. FBS does, however, receive compensation from options exchanges and/or brokers associated with the routing of options order flow. 
Options markets are structurally different from equities markets. Options orders require the use of specialized options brokers to deliver price improvement, all options trades must occur on ​an exchange and are subject to exchange pricing schedules. Brokers may pass to FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, a portion of the compensation they generate via exchange executions.
Options orders in some securities, such as index options, may incur execution costs rather than rebates, and options brokers may pass through those execution costs to NFS. Index options may be routed to options brokers with different allocations than non-index options, and as such, the per-contract fees and rebates may look materially different across options brokers.</materialAspects>
