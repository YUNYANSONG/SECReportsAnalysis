                    <materialAspects>FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, may incur fees or receive rebates for orders executed on specific equities exchanges.
FBS orders generally meet the exchange’s definition of retail, and as such FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, attests that its retail order flow is eligible for any exchange economics associated with that designation.
Rebates are generally for limit orders required to be displayed on exchange per the SEC Limit Order Display Rule but may also include marketable orders executed on certain exchanges.
Non-Marketable Limit orders routed to MEMX are generally attested as retail, meet the exchange’s definition of “Added displayed volume, Retail order”, and qualify for the base rebate rate. 
Economics associated with Market orders, Marketable Limit orders and Other orders may represent a variety of different interaction types on the exchange, including but not limited to: displaying limit orders on the exchange; and removing liquidity on the exchange.
The per-share economics described on this report represent a mix of interactions on the exchange. Fees and rebates are set by exchange rules, subject to SEC approval, and are non-negotiable. Visit exchange websites directly for detailed price lists: https://info.memxtrading.com/fee-schedule/

                    <materialAspects>FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, may incur fees or receive rebates for orders executed on specific equities exchanges.
FBS orders generally meet the exchange’s definition of retail, and as such FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, attests that its retail order flow is eligible for any exchange economics associated with that designation.
Rebates are generally for limit orders required to be displayed on exchange per the SEC Limit Order Display Rule but may also include marketable orders executed on certain exchanges.
Economics associated with Market orders, Marketable Limit orders and Other orders may represent a variety of different interaction types on the exchange, including but not limited to: participating in the exchange’s opening or closing auction; displaying limit orders on the exchange; and removing liquidity on the exchange.
The per-share economics described on this report represent a mix of interactions on the exchange.
Fees and rebates are set by exchange rules, subject to SEC approval, and are non-negotiable. Visit exchange websites directly for detailed price lists: https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/NYSE_Arca_Marketplace_Fees.pdf</materialAspects>

Rebates are generally for limit orders required to be displayed on exchange per the SEC Limit Order Display Rule but may also include marketable orders executed on certain exchanges.
Non-Marketable Limit orders routed to MEMX are generally attested as retail, meet the exchange’s definition of “Added displayed volume, Retail order”, and qualify for the base rebate rate. 
Economics associated with Market orders, Marketable Limit orders and Other orders may represent a variety of different interaction types on the exchange, including but not limited to: displaying limit orders on the exchange; and removing liquidity on the exchange.
The per-share economics described on this report represent a mix of interactions on the exchange. Fees and rebates are set by exchange rules, subject to SEC approval, and are non-negotiable. Visit exchange websites directly for detailed price lists: https://info.memxtrading.com/fee-schedule/

                    <materialAspects>FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, may incur fees or receive rebates for orders executed on specific equities exchanges. 
FBS orders generally meet the exchange’s definition of retail, and as such FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, attests that its retail order flow is eligible for any exchange economics associated with that designation.
Rebates are generally for limit orders required to be displayed on exchange per the SEC Limit Order Display Rule but may also include marketable orders executed on certain exchanges.
Non-Marketable Limit orders routed to Cboe EDGX are generally attested as retail, meet the exchange’s definition of “Retail Order, adds liquidity”, and qualify for the base rebate rate.
Economics associated with Market orders, Marketable Limit orders and Other orders may represent a variety of different interaction types on the exchange, including but not limited to: displaying limit orders on the exchange; and removing liquidity on the exchange.
The per-share economics described on this report represent a mix of interactions on the exchange. Fees and rebates are set by exchange rules, subject to SEC approval, and are non-negotiable.

FBS orders generally meet the exchange’s definition of retail, and as such FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, attests that its retail order flow is eligible for any exchange economics associated with that designation.
Rebates are generally for limit orders required to be displayed on exchange per the SEC Limit Order Display Rule but may also include marketable orders executed on certain exchanges. Non-Marketable Limit orders routed to Nasdaq are generally attested as retail, meet the exchange’s definition of “Rebate to Add Displayed Designated Retail Liquidity”, and qualify for the base rebate rate.
Economics associated with Market orders, Marketable Limit orders and Other orders may represent a variety of different interaction types on the exchange, including but not limited to: participating in the exchange’s opening or closing auction; displaying limit orders on the exchange; and removing liquidity on the exchange.
The per-share economics described on this report represent a mix of interactions on the exchange. Fees and rebates are set by exchange rules, subject to SEC approval, and are non-negotiable.

                    <materialAspects>FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, may incur fees or receive rebates for orders executed on specific equities exchanges. 
FBS orders generally meet the exchange’s definition of retail, and as such FBS, through its affiliated broker-dealer NFS, attests that its retail order flow is eligible for any exchange economics associated with that designation.
Rebates are generally for limit orders required to be displayed on exchange per the SEC Limit Order Display Rule but may also include marketable orders executed on certain exchanges.
Non-Marketable Limit orders routed to Cboe EDGX are generally attested as retail, meet the exchange’s definition of “Retail Order, adds liquidity”, and qualify for the base rebate rate.
Economics associated with Market orders, Marketable Limit orders and Other orders may represent a variety of different interaction types on the exchange, including but not limited to: displaying limit orders on the exchange; and removing liquidity on the exchange.
The per-share economics described on this report represent a mix of interactions on the exchange. Fees and rebates are set by exchange rules, subject to SEC approval, and are non-negotiable.
