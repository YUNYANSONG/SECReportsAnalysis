          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more.  E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share.  E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel.

There is a potential conflict inherent to a market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  A market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer executions are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Citadel receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Citadel’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Citadel may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing.  To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under NASDAQ’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply.  Because NASDAQ offers higher rebates and lower fees based on a tiered volume model, there is a potential conflict in that such rebates and fees could, in theory, incentivize E*TRADE to route a higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to NASDAQ rather than another venue in order to reach a higher tier.  E*TRADE and NASDAQ do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds; 
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule as described above; or 
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to NASDAQ.

The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from NASDAQ for NMS equity executions are determined based on NASDAQ’s tiered volume model.

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more.  E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share.  E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel.

There is a potential conflict inherent to a market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  A market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer executions are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Citadel receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Citadel’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Citadel may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Jane Street Capital (“Jane Street”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Jane Street generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Jane Street in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more.  E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Jane Street for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share.  E*TRADE and Jane Street do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Jane Street.

There is a potential conflict inherent to a market maker such as Jane Street both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Jane Street can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  A market maker’s (such as Jane Street’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Jane Street may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Jane Street also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Jane Street to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Jane Street’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Jane Street for E*TRADE customer executions are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Jane Street receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Jane Street’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Jane Street’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Jane Street may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes U.S.-listed options orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders.  E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel.
E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis.  

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract, depending on the index option class and premium price, with Citadel passing exchange fees for index option executions back to E*TRADE each month.  For Q3 2022, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index executions of $354,715 in July, $477,867 in August, and $440,033 in September.     

There is a potential conflict inherent to an options market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the options market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, an options market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  An options market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  Citadel does not pass through the fees that it is charged by the U.S. options exchanges for E*TRADE customer executions, other than the index option fees described above.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any profits from U.S. options exchange rebates for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Citadel’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Citadel may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes U.S.-listed options orders to Dash Financial Technologies, LLC (“Dash”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Dash generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Dash (based upon the remuneration Dash receives from the liquidity providers with which it has arrangements as described below) in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders.

E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Dash for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis.

For Q3 2022, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index option executions of $240,384 in July, $324,447 in August, and $338,677 in September.     

In connection with Dash ’s handling of E*TRADE retail equity option orders, Dash has arrangements with multiple, unaffiliated liquidity providers, including IMC Financial Markets, designed to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities.  Pursuant to these arrangements, Dash routes E*TRADE retail equity options orders to exchanges and may preference the liquidity providers on such applicable exchange, consistent with exchange-sponsored programs which are described in the fee schedules of each such options exchange. The liquidity providers provide Dash with remuneration in connection with Dash ’s routing of E*TRADE retail equity options orders, including through reciprocal order flow arrangements between Dash and such liquidity provider and/or payment per contract to Dash in return for E*TRADE retail equity options orders that Dash routes or directs.  Dash provides remuneration to E*TRADE as described above based upon the compensation Dash receives from such liquidity providers.

There is a potential conflict inherent to Dash and/or the liquidity provider to which Dash routes orders both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the liquidity provider seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, the liquidity provider can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay Dash (and for Dash, in turn, to pay E*TRADE) for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  The liquidity provider’s anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.  Dash and the liquidity provider can also adjust the amount of such profit that the liquidity provider shares with Dash.

In addition to revenues that Dash may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Dash may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates.

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more.  E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share.  E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel.

There is a potential conflict inherent to a market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  A market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer executions are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Citadel receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Citadel’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Citadel may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing.  To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under NASDAQ’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply.

E*TRADE and NASDAQ do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds; 
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule as described above; or 
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to NASDAQ.

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more.  E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share.  E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel.

There is a potential conflict inherent to a market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  A market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer executions are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Citadel receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Citadel’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Citadel may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Jane Street Capital (“Jane Street”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Jane Street generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Jane Street in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more.  E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Jane Street for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share.  E*TRADE and Jane Street do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Jane Street.

There is a potential conflict inherent to a market maker such as Jane Street both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Jane Street can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  A market maker’s (such as Jane Street’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Jane Street may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Jane Street also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Jane Street to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Jane Street’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Jane Street for E*TRADE customer executions are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Jane Street receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Jane Street’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Jane Street’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Jane Street may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes U.S.-listed options orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders.  E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel.
E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis.  

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract, depending on the index option class and premium price, with Citadel passing exchange fees for index option executions back to E*TRADE each month.  For Q3 2022, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index executions of $354,715 in July, $477,867 in August, and $440,033 in September.     

There is a potential conflict inherent to an options market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the options market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, an options market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  An options market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  Citadel does not pass through the fees that it is charged by the U.S. options exchanges for E*TRADE customer executions, other than the index option fees described above.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any profits from U.S. options exchange rebates for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Citadel’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Citadel may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes U.S.-listed options orders to Dash Financial Technologies, LLC (“Dash”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Dash generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Dash (based upon the remuneration Dash receives from the liquidity providers with which it has arrangements as described below) in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders.  E*TRADE and Dash do not have any arrangements:

E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Dash for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis.  

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract depending on the index option class and premium price, with Dash passing exchange fees for index option executions to E*TRADE each month.  For Q3 2022, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index option executions of $240,384 in July, $324,447 in August, and $338,677 in September.     

In connection with Dash ’s handling of E*TRADE retail equity option orders, Dash has arrangements with multiple, unaffiliated liquidity providers, including IMC Financial Markets, designed to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities.  Pursuant to these arrangements, Dash routes E*TRADE retail equity options orders to exchanges and may preference the liquidity providers on such applicable exchange, consistent with exchange-sponsored programs which are described in the fee schedules of each such options exchange. The liquidity providers provide Dash with remuneration in connection with Dash ’s routing of E*TRADE retail equity options orders, including through reciprocal order flow arrangements between Dash and such liquidity provider and/or payment per contract to Dash in return for E*TRADE retail equity options orders that Dash routes or directs.  Dash provides remuneration to E*TRADE as described above based upon the compensation Dash receives from such liquidity providers.

There is a potential conflict inherent to Dash and/or the liquidity provider to which Dash routes orders both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the liquidity provider seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, the liquidity provider can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay Dash (and for Dash, in turn, to pay E*TRADE) for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  The liquidity provider’s anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.  Dash and the liquidity provider can also adjust the amount of such profit that the liquidity provider shares with Dash.

In addition to revenues that Dash may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Dash may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Dash to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Dash’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.

However, E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley, which is a Market Maker on various U.S. options exchanges and may realize profits from orders it routes for execution. E*TRADE may share directly or indirectly in any such profits generated by Morgan Stanley and E*TRADE and Morgan Stanley order execution volumes are combined on a monthly basis for tiered pricing program incentive purposes.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more.  E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share.  E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel.

There is a potential conflict inherent to a market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  A market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.

The fees and rebates referenced above are subject to volume pricing.  To the extent that E*TRADE meets the execution volume thresholds necessary to qualify for preferred pricing under NASDAQ’s Fees Schedule in a given month, increased (rather than standard) rebate rates and decreased (rather than standard) fees will apply.

E*TRADE and NASDAQ do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds; 
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds; 
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules beyond the tiered volume model set forth in the NASDAQ Fees Schedule as described above; or 
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to NASDAQ.

The fees E*TRADE pays and rebates E*TRADE receives from NASDAQ for NMS equity executions are determined based on NASDAQ’s tiered volume model.

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more.  E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share.  E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel.

There is a potential conflict inherent to a market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  A market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer executions are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Citadel receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Citadel’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Citadel may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes NMS equity orders to Jane Street Capital (“Jane Street”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Jane Street generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Jane Street in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.002 per share for non-directed, NMS equity market and marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more and $0.0031 per share for non-directed, NMS equity non-marketable limit order executions priced at $1.00 per share or more.  E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Jane Street for NMS equity executions priced below $1.00 per share.  E*TRADE and Jane Street do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Jane Street.

There is a potential conflict inherent to a market maker such as Jane Street both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, a market maker such as Jane Street can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  A market maker’s (such as Jane Street’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Jane Street may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Jane Street also receives remuneration from U.S. securities exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Jane Street to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Jane Street’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Jane Street for E*TRADE customer executions are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any such rebates Jane Street receives for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Jane Street’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Jane Street’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Jane Street may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

          <materialAspects>E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE”) routes U.S.-listed options orders to Citadel Securities LLC (“Citadel”) to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities for its customers.  Citadel generates revenue from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  In exchange for such routing, E*TRADE receives remuneration from Citadel in the amounts outlined in the above Public Order Routing Report disclosures, calculated at a rate of $0.48 per contract for simple and complex equity options orders.  E*TRADE and Citadel do not have any arrangements:

A.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain volume thresholds or that provide incentives to E*TRADE for meeting or exceeding certain volume thresholds;
B.	that require E*TRADE to meet certain minimum volume thresholds or that provide disincentives to E*TRADE for failing to meet certain minimum volume thresholds;
C.	for volume-based tiered payment schedules; or
D.	that require E*TRADE to route any orders or a minimum number of orders to Citadel.
E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Citadel for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis.  

In general, public, retail, or non-professional index options order execution fees range from $0.00 to $1.32 per contract, depending on the index option class and premium price, with Citadel passing exchange fees for index option executions back to E*TRADE each month.  For Q3 2022, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index executions of $354,715 in July, $477,867 in August, and $440,033 in September.     

There is a potential conflict inherent to an options market maker such as Citadel both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the options market maker seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, an options market maker such as Citadel can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  An options market maker’s (such as Citadel’s) anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.

In addition to revenues that Citadel may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Citadel may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates.  Although E*TRADE has no knowledge of any facts to suggest that such is the case, these U.S. options exchange rebate payments could, in theory, incentivize Citadel to route higher percentages of E*TRADE customer orders to particular venues over others, subject to Citadel’s independent order routing and best execution obligations.  Exchange rebates provided to Citadel for E*TRADE customer executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  Citadel does not pass through the fees that it is charged by the U.S. options exchanges for E*TRADE customer executions, other than the index option fees described above.  E*TRADE does not share directly in any profits from U.S. options exchange rebates for executions of E*TRADE customer orders, although Citadel’s receipt of such rebates potentially increases Citadel’s revenue and thereby the source of funds Citadel may use to provide price improvement to E*TRADE customers, order flow payment to E*TRADE, and/or a combination of such payments.</materialAspects>

E*TRADE does not receive remuneration from Dash for index options executions or for Professional Customer orders, which are orders of customers who submit an average of 390 options orders per trading day, per calendar month, on a quarterly basis.

For Q3 2022, E*TRADE paid total fees on customer index option executions of $240,384 in July, $324,447 in August, and $338,677 in September.     

In connection with Dash ’s handling of E*TRADE retail equity option orders, Dash has arrangements with multiple, unaffiliated liquidity providers, including IMC Financial Markets, designed to facilitate liquidity provision and price improvement opportunities.  Pursuant to these arrangements, Dash routes E*TRADE retail equity options orders to exchanges and may preference the liquidity providers on such applicable exchange, consistent with exchange-sponsored programs which are described in the fee schedules of each such options exchange. The liquidity providers provide Dash with remuneration in connection with Dash ’s routing of E*TRADE retail equity options orders, including through reciprocal order flow arrangements between Dash and such liquidity provider and/or payment per contract to Dash in return for E*TRADE retail equity options orders that Dash routes or directs.  Dash provides remuneration to E*TRADE as described above based upon the compensation Dash receives from such liquidity providers.

There is a potential conflict inherent to Dash and/or the liquidity provider to which Dash routes orders both paying for order flow and providing price improvement, as the potential source of funds for each is the same, namely the anticipated profit the liquidity provider seeks to earn from executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders.  Accordingly, from such anticipated profit, the liquidity provider can (i) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to provide price improvement; (ii) forgo a portion of such anticipated profit to pay Dash (and for Dash, in turn, to pay E*TRADE) for order flow; or (iii) retain a larger portion of anticipated profit and not provide (or provide less) price improvement or not provide (or provide less) payment for order flow.  The liquidity provider’s anticipated profit must be allocated among these three sub-categories, such that an increased allocation to any one sub-category will result in a decreased allocation to one or more of the other categories.  Dash and the liquidity provider can also adjust the amount of such profit that the liquidity provider shares with Dash.

In addition to revenues that Dash may collect for executing or facilitating the execution of E*TRADE customer orders, Dash may also receive remuneration from the U.S. options exchanges to which it routes or directs E*TRADE customer options orders in the form of rebates.

Exchange rebates provided and fees changed to Morgan Stanley for E*TRADE customer executions by the U.S. options exchanges are not passed through to E*TRADE or its customers.  However, E*TRADE is an affiliated company of Morgan Stanley, which is a Market Maker on various U.S. options exchanges and may realize profits from orders it routes for execution. E*TRADE may share directly or indirectly in any such profits generated by Morgan Stanley and E*TRADE and Morgan Stanley order execution volumes are combined on a monthly basis for tiered pricing program incentive purposes.</materialAspects>
